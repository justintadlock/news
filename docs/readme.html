<h1>News WordPress theme</h1>

<p class="first"><em>News</em> is a theme that was designed to answer many of the problems that other "news" themes have in the WordPress community.  Rather than simply slapping a big featured slider above a list of posts and calling it a news theme, we spent time looking at what makes news sites work and translated those features into a WordPress theme.</p>

<p class="second">The theme has multiple sidebars, extra custom templates, theme-specific widgets, slideshows, and many other awesome features.  It was built to actually handle the presentational aspects of a real-world news site.</p>

<h2>Child themes</h2>

<p>Since <em>News</em> is a parent theme, you'll want to create a child theme if you plan on making any customizations.  <em>Don't know how to make a child theme?</em>  It's relatively simple.  Just follow the below steps.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a theme folder in your <code>/wp-content/themes</code> directory called <code>news-child</code>.</li>
	<li>Then, create a <code>style.css</code> file within your theme folder.</li>
	<li>At the top of your <code>style.css</code> file, add the below information.</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>/**
 * Theme Name: News Child
 * Theme URI: http://link-to-your-site.com
 * Description: Describe what your theme should be like.
 * Version: 0.1
 * Author: Your Name
 * Author URI: http://link-to-your-site.com
 * Tags: Add, Whatever, Tags, You, Want
 * Template: news
 */</code></pre>

<p>This will give you a blank design.  If you want to import the <em>News</em> parent theme style, simply append this code after the above information:</p>

<pre><code>@import url( '../news/style.css' );

/* Custom code goes below here. */</code></pre>

<p>Note that child themes are now the officially-supported way of modifying themes in WordPress.</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<h3>Upgrading from version 0.1 or 0.2?</h3>

<p>When this theme was originally developed, some code was added to it that I didn't think belonged in a WordPress theme.  Unfortunately, I was overruled by the rest of the development team.  However, I now control the development of this theme, which means some things have changed.</p>

<p><strong>Slideshow and Video post types:</strong>  These things are no longer a supported part of this theme.  I have included a plugin called "News Post Types" for those of you who wish to continue using these features.  To use this plugin, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Open your <code>news</code> theme folder.</li>
	<li>Copy the <code>news-post-types</code> folder (and its contents) from the <code>plugins</code> folder within your theme.</li>
	<li>Place the <code>news-post-types</code> folder within your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> directory.  From that point, you'll treat it just like a regular plugin.</li>
	<li>Now, copy the <code>slideshow.php</code>, <code>video.php</code>, <code>sidebar-slideshow.php</code>, and <code>sidebar-video.php</code> files into your child theme folder.  <em>Not using a child theme?</em>  Follow the steps outlined above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that these features <strong>will be removed</strong> from a future version of this theme.  If you want to use them, you definitely need to follow the above steps.</p>

<h2>Theme support</h2>

<p>Support for the <em>News</em> theme is not offered on the WordPress support forums.  There is a community called <a href="http://themehybrid.com" title="Theme Hybrid">Theme Hybrid</a> where support is offered for this theme.  You are encouraged to sign up to the site to use its support forums and become a part of the community.</p>
